# Diagnostic Tool

This small application is designed for the company [PEG spol. s r.o.](https://peg.cz). It should be able to read and change values from a device. I decided to use [customtkinter](https://customtkinter.tomschimansky.com), as it is easier to use than classic [tkinter](https://docs.python.org/3/library/tkinter.html).
